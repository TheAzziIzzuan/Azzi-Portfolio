        <p style="text-align:justify">The second webinar is all about how to protect your organization or personal network, by using a hacker perspective this webinar teaches you how to configure network security or organization security network. The webinar goes through on how a
            hacker accomplishes its goal by showing how they hack into an organization network and also showing the vulnerability that you might make when configuring organization security. I have learned a lot from the second webinar, on how to configure
            the security network, and using also the steps and advice are given from the speakers helps me a lot in the future if were to pursue this line in the future.
