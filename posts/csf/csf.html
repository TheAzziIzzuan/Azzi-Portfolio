        <h3>Cross-Site Request Forgery Explanation</h3>

        <p>
            <br>
            <br> Cross-Site Request Forgery is an attacker sends a malicious link to the victim seems harmless but it performs an unwanted action.
            <br>
            <br> An example would be transferring funds without the victim knowing.
            <br>
            <h5>Some of Cross-Site Request Forgery characteristic are:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>- It involves sites that rely on a user’s identity</li>
                <li>- Exploits the site’s trust in that identity</li>
                <li>- Tricks the user’s browser into sending HTTP requests to a target site</li>
                <li>- HTTP request involving side effects</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>How CSRF works?</h5>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/csf/backend.png">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align:justify">A CSRF attack is successful because the web application architecture of browser requests automatically includes user credentials associated with the web application such as the user's session cookie, IP address, etc without the need of the attack
            to set it on the header. Hence, if the user is authenticated to the site, the site cannot distinguish between the forged or legitimate request sent by the victim. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/csf/next.png">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Before the hacker can execute the attack on the victim, the hacker must first locate a website where the security level is low, the hacker will then try to make use of the low-security level to create a script where the database will accept the
            victims session-id thinking that they already authenticate at the first authentication site, therefore tricking the database into performing the request made by the customer without them knowing. The hacker will first make the script by getting
            a request from the website, using the burp suite. Example of the code ('GET', 'http://localhost:3000/rest/user/change-password?new=
            <>&repeat=
                <>');</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h5>What is session IDs or Session Token?</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">A piece of data is used for a network to communicate, exchange series of a related message and to keep track of the user’s responses and request. When a user visits a web site, a new session ID will be generated by the server and assign it to
            establish trust between two end point. The site will generate a new session ID whenever a web is reopened. However, the same session ID will remain the same as long as the connection between endpoint is not refreshed, even if the user leaves
            the site in question and returns. The session IDs or Session token are often used to identify a user that has logged into a website. The session IDs/Token can be stored as a cookie, form field, or URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</p>

        </div>

        <h5>Why defend against it?</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">CSRF uses that fact that the website will just execute an action despite where it comes from. As more and more services come into the online world like banking services and other important services, without defence against CSRF, just by clicking
            the wrong link, the attacker forces you to do unwanted actions without you even knowing! Although it can become a very big issue, there are many ways to mitigate CSRF. A CSRF token is one of the common way to prevent CSRF.</p>

        </div>

        <h5>Now, what is a CSRF Token?</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">CSFR token uses the synchronizer token pattern. A CSRF token is unique and is assigned per user session, a large random value, and generated by cryptographically secure random number generator. The attack will not be able to predict the CSRF token.
            The CSRF token is stored in a hidden field where the attacker will not know. AJAX calls the parameter from the hidden field and within the URL if the state changing operation occurs via a GET Request. The server will reject the forged request
            because the CSRF token validation is False.</p>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="../../images/csf/forbidden.png">
        </div>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The attacker will not be able to forge the POST request by setting the custom request header through XMLHttpRequest. When the attacker attempts to set a custom header through GET or POST XMLHttpRequest, the browser sends the OPTIONS request.</p>
