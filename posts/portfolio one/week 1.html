        <h3>Week 1 Portfolio I</h3>

        <h5>Day 1, 14 October 2019</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Back to school and the first thing i did in school is a little of engineering and electronics combined i guess, for Portfolio 1, we have been introduced to a set of hardware and software toolkits. For the first day we have been introduced to a
            breadboard which is to test circuit, the first practical we have to do is the connecting wires to the breadboard and attempt to light up the led using the breadboard and raspberry pi combined, of course my classmates and me have a difficult
            time understanding the concepts, but with our lecturer's guide we manage to connect the wires and raspberry pi, my partner Dickson and I manage to complete the breadboard but did not attempt to light up the led as we have not much confident.
            What i have learn?, I learned about how the current flows from battery to the led and also the formula for current flow which is V = IR, if we were to put the led legs opposite it will blow out the led and also i have learned that i should
            not connect the led directly to the 5v as it will also blow out the led.</p>

        <h5>Day 2, 17 October 2019</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The next lesson my partner and I decide to have the confidence to attempt to light up the LED with the assist of our lectures, at first we have a difficult time to light up the LED, as we thought we have done something wrong. After much of redoing
            and attempt to debug the problem, we ask out lecturer for help. The first thing that our lecturer did is check out wire connection and our program code. The problem is our button is placed not connecting to the circuit which is funny as we
            take 15 mins to test everything out and ended up with a button not connecting to the circuit board, here a picture of the breadboard with led lights up..</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">The next lab is to connect a display and display a text using the code provided by the practical document, on this lab my partner and I manage to display the text on the display without any major problems, only a coding problem where we need to
            change the driver address to 0x27. This is because the display has an address which the raspberry pi is unable to detect, by changing the address this will make the pi detect the display and will manage to run the code to the display.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">from this lesson i have learned a command that enable us to see which wires and device is connected to which number on the bread board using this command "sudo i2cdetect".</p>

        <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify">This has made me thinking that pursing triple E and electronics is hard enough, as I am unable to do simple connecting using breadboard, but this has not make me have the urge to gives up as i love to learn new things, anyways i am looking forward
            to week 2 practical.</p>
