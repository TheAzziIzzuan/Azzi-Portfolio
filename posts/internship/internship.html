        <h3>Internship</h3>
        <h5>Read Full Report <a href="../../posts/internship/Final Report.pdf" target="_blank">Here!</a></h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> During my internship at Shimano, I was involved in various aspects of daily IT operations, such as addressing user issues, providing troubleshooting solutions, and installing or upgrading software programs on users' computers or laptops. This
            internship provided me with valuable insights into how IT operations are managed in the industry.
            <br> <br> In addition to assisting with daily IT operations, I collaborated on the development of a Cybersecurity Awareness Program. This project involved researching and utilizing the knowledge that I gained from school to create relevant
            content.
            <br> I also had the opportunity to present and conduct training lessons for Shimano employees locally and oversea using Microsoft Teams, ensuring that they understood the importance of cybersecurity. <br> <br>To test their understanding, I
            created a 20-question multiple-choice quiz. Throughout this project, Mr. Ron provided me with guidance and support, helping me create a project planner to keep track of all the necessary dates and meetings, and ensuring that I completed the
            project on time.<br>
            <Br>Apart from developing the cybersecurity training program, I also assisted the IT department with upgrading most of the workstations, laptops, and desktops to the latest versions. Additionally, I created a Microsoft Teams Training guide using
            Microsoft PowerPoint to assist first-time users. Overall, my internship at Shimano allowed me to gain practical experience in various aspects of IT operations, develop my cybersecurity knowledge and skills, and contribute to the company's
            success.

        <h5>Office 365 & Windows 10 Upgrade</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The purpose of this assignment is for me to keep our whole factory in compliance. I've learned that starting on 14 January 2020, Microsoft will no longer offer support and security updates for computers that are running Windows 7 (as noted by
            csa.gov). This means that our computers running Windows 7 will become vulnerable to security risks. To prevent this, I will upgrade these computers to Windows 10 so that they can continue to receive updates and security patches from Microsoft.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">For this assignment, I have to collaborate with Adi to gather a list of computers that need to be upgraded to either Office 365 or Windows 10. Once I retrieved the list, I had to personally visit each computer or laptop and perform the upgrade.
            The duration of the upgrade varied depending on the computer or laptop's condition; Office 365 upgrade took 20-30 minutes, while the Windows 10 upgrade took around 3-4 hours. Since there are numerous computers and laptops that require upgrading,
            this has become a daily routine for me. I also have to keep the excel sheet updated with the computers that are done and inform Adi of the progress.</P>

        <p>Unable to show company excel file due to PDPA</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Daily IT Operations</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify">As an IT professional, my daily operations involve providing assistance to users in troubleshooting the hardware or software problems they face with their laptops. Besides offering user support, I also assist in configuring new hardware, ranging
            from tablets to workstations. This includes installing software applications that upgrade the laptops and workstations.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The purpose of my assignment is to assist users with any problems they encounter to enhance the factory's efficiency. One way to achieve this is to minimize the downtime of desktops or workstations. Additionally, Shimano is scheduled to move to
            a new factory in November 2021. Therefore, this assignment will prepare the IT department for the transition by checking all the equipment and computers to ensure they are functioning correctly. This will also provide me with the opportunity
            to gain experience troubleshooting various devices and understand how the moving process works.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify">I have contributed to the IT department by bringing back workstations from other departments, reformatting and cleaning them, and upgrading the PCs before returning them to their respective departments. Additionally, I have been responsible for
            configuring newly arrived PCs, workstations, and tablets, which will be deployed and used in the new factory in November. In my experience, some of the significant issues that users encounter are slow workstations or computers, which can be
            caused by not restarting or letting the device rest. Other common issues are software installation requests that require admin rights and setting up desktops or laptops for new hires, also known as deployment.</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Microsoft Teams Training</h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify">I have found that using the inbuilt chat system on Microsoft Teams allows users in the Shimano factory to stay organized and communicate with each other more efficiently than email. This feature is particularly useful in increasing productivity
            regardless of where the users are located in the factory, especially during the current pandemic. By encouraging the use of Microsoft Teams, we can increase workload and productivity levels.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">As part of my assignment, I guide users on how to conduct meetings with each other on Microsoft Teams and Outlook applications. I also offer guidance on how to have conversations within channels and collaborate with teammates to edit files on
            the team. Additionally, I recommend online video calling, which provides the option for users to change their background and share their screen while presenting.</p>

        <h5>Personal Reflection</h5>
        <p style="text-align: justify">For Assignment 1 (Cyber Security Awareness), I and Aaron presented to 588 employees of Shimano, including local and overseas employees. The average score of the employees who took the quiz is 17.66 out of 20, and the median is 18 out of 20, which
            means that almost all of them have passed the quiz on the first attempt. After the training session, I created a presentation deck for new hires and presented it on their first day to talk about Cyber Security. Unfortunately, due to the current
            pandemic Covid-19 phase 2 heightened alert, the orientation on Cybersecurity has been cancelled, and I had to convert the presentation deck to PDF and send it to users for them to self-learn. Due to Aaron's departure, the phishing simulation
            could not be completed. Mr. Ron is planning to do something about it as almost all of the workers in Shimano understand the basics of Cyber Security.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">For Assignment 2 (Office 365 & Windows 10 Upgrade), I updated all the outdated computers, laptops, and workstations. The total number of updates cannot be disclosed due to confidential information. However, there are still some outstanding tasks
            such as machines that cannot be corrected. These machines are required to run for 24 hours a day, which left some of the appliances outdated and not compliant with the standards.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">For Assignment 3 (Daily IT Operations), my objective is to solve everyday IT problems that are reported to the IT department. This includes troubleshooting, assembling new parts, and configuring them. Some of the issues include the inability to
            access email, hard disk unable to read data, and laptop battery replacement. Currently, there are no outstanding tasks as every problem that is reported is being solved instantly.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">For Assignment 4 (Microsoft Teams Training), I created a PowerPoint guide on using Microsoft Teams and its features. The PowerPoint guide was submitted to the higher management to learn how to use Microsoft Teams, especially for those who are
            using it for the first time. There are no outstanding tasks for this project as I only needed to create the PowerPoint Guide and submit it to Mr. Ron for approval.</p>
